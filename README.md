Email Sorting
The Email Sorting application involves a text classification task using supervised learning techniques. It trains a model on a labeled dataset of emails that have been manually categorized into different folders. By learning patterns and features from the text data, such as keywords, language patterns, and contextual information, the model determines the appropriate folder for incoming emails. Machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based architectures can be utilized. Additional features like sender information, email metadata, or user preferences can enhance the model's performance. The aim is to accurately allocate incoming emails to relevant folders, providing users with an organized and efficient email management system.

Automated Essay Grading
Automated Essay Grading involves the use of NLP techniques to evaluate and assign grades to essays. The model analyzes various aspects of the essay, including grammar, vocabulary, coherence, argumentation, and adherence to the prompt or rubric. Techniques like part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and semantic analysis extract meaningful information from the essay. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in identifying relevant essay characteristics for grading. Machine learning algorithms, such as regression models or neural networks, map these features to a grading scale. The model is trained on a large dataset of essays manually graded by human experts to learn the relationship between essay features and grades. The goal is to provide consistent and efficient grading for large-scale assessments, reducing the workload of human graders while maintaining a high level of accuracy.

Medical Diagnosis Assistance
The Medical Diagnosis Assistance application in NLP aims to support doctors in the diagnostic process. The model functions as a conversational agent, collecting relevant information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and other contextual details from doctors. Natural language understanding (NLU) and question-answering techniques help comprehend and extract key information from the doctor's responses. This extracted information is compared and matched against a vast medical knowledge base, including clinical guidelines, research papers, electronic health records, and relevant medical literature. Advanced algorithms, such as probabilistic reasoning or machine learning, generate probable diagnoses based on the collected information and medical knowledge. These diagnoses serve as suggestions or recommendations for doctors in their decision-making process. The goal is to assist doctors in reaching accurate and timely diagnoses by leveraging the power of NLP, medical knowledge, and computational reasoning.
